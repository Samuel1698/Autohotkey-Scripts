This is the current autohotkeys scripts and functions that I use daily

## How to use Reactions

The script 'DiscordReaction.ahk' allows you to type any phrase in the discord emoji box as a reaction to a message, type the phrase followed by `!!r` and the script will write whatever you typed as a series of reaction emotes.

Example:

![ezgif com-gif-maker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43931665/133355447-d680c8a8-9aee-497e-a2d7-5f43d4c01035.gif)


This script works by using custom emotes that are the exact same as the default alphabet, you can find these emotes by joining these two servers
https://discord.gg/FvbG9Qc and https://discord.gg/AFJZ6Bs (There's no text channels, only emotes). Otherwise, you'd only be able to type words containing 1 of each letter maximum.
